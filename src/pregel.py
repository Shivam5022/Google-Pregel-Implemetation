            PAPER: The Pregel library divides a graph into partitions, each
            consisting of a set of vertices and all of those verticesâ€™ outgoing edges. 
            Assignment of a vertex to a partition depends
            solely on the vertex ID, which implies it is possible to know
            which partition a given vertex belongs to even if the vertex is
            owned by a different machine, or even if the vertex does not
            yet exist. 
            The default partitioning function is just hash(ID)
            mod N, where N is the number of partitions, but users can
            replace it.
